A Genetic Algorithm is an algorithm that uses natural selection, or survival of the fittest, to find a solution to a problem. All Genetic Algorithms follow a similar, if not identical structure (figure \ref{struct}). However, the elements of this structure are highly customised for each specific application. Before going into detail about these elements, the concept of chromosomes must first be introduced.

Chromosomes are the most important part of a GA, their only purpose is
